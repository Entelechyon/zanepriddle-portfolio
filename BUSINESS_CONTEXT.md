## LEAD CAPTURE SYSTEM

**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL

**How It Works:**
1. User chats with AI chatbot on zanepriddle.com
2. Chatbot naturally extracts: name, email, phone, company, project type, budget
3. When minimum data collected (name + email + project type):
   - POST request to Google Apps Script webhook
   - Lead saved to Client_Pipeline_CRM Google Sheet
   - Email notification sent to entelechian88@gmail.com
   - Duplicate prevention (won't submit twice)

**Webhook URL:**
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzp-rmGWIw3hF3kJ2-aTS16u9_063EvojzTFA3SxHnyU6eWAUGE7o6orxToskd1ZcOGEQ/exec
```

**Files Involved:**
- Frontend: `components/ChatbotWidget.tsx`
- Backend: `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Google Apps Script: Attached to Client_Pipeline_CRM sheet
